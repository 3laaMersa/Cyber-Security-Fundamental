**The Internet treats VMs as an independent device with an IP and Mac address.  This is more secure in case the device is hacked from the network.**

**Advantages:**

-   The VM gets an IP address from the same DHCP server as the host, making it fully accessible from other machines on the network.
-   It allows the VM to communicate with any device on the physical network, just like the host.

**Use Cases:**

-   Suitable for scenarios where the VM needs to be treated as a fully independent device on the network.
-   Useful for services that need to be accessed by other devices on the network, like web servers or databases.
# Nat


 NAT creates a private network for the VM where the VM gets an IP address that is not directly visible on the external network.
    The VM accesses external networks through the hostâ€™s IP address via NAT.

Advantages:

    Provides an additional layer of security by isolating the VM from the external network.
    Easy to set up without requiring changes to the network infrastructure.

Use Cases:

    Ideal for situations where the VM needs to access the internet or external networks without being accessed from those networks.
    Suitable for client applications or when testing internet connectivity.

# Host-only
Host-only networking creates a private network between the host and the VMs.
    The VM can communicate only with the host and other VMs configured in the same host-only network.

Advantages:

    Provides a completely isolated network for testing and development.
    No exposure to external networks or the internet, enhancing security.

Use Cases:

    Suitable for environments where VMs need to communicate only with the host and each other.
    Ideal for isolated development and testing environments or for simulating private networks.

Additional Considerations

    Performance: Bridged networking may have better performance for network-intensive applications compared to NAT.
    Security: Host-only networking offers the highest level of isolation, while Bridged can expose the VM to the same vulnerabilities as the host.
    Configuration: Bridged networking might require configuration of network infrastructure (like routers and switches), whereas NAT and Host-only are simpler to set up.

Understanding these networking modes and choosing the appropriate one is crucial for setting up VMs to meet specific requirements for connectivity, security, and performance.
