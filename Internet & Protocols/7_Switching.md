# Switching


**Switching** in IT and computer networking is the transfer of data packets, or blocks of data, through a network switch. Switches transfer data from source ports on devices such as computers to destination ports on devices such as routers.

### MAC addresses
-  MAC [ Media Access Control ] address is also known as the physical address
- Every NIC on any device in your network has a MAC address and an IP address.
- MAC addresses are 48-bit (6 bytes) long and are expressed in hexadecimal form (HEX)

`Broadcast MAC Address : FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`

While [**routers**](https://github.com/3laaMersa/Cyber-Security-Fundamental/blob/main/Internet%20&%20Protocols/8_Routing.md) work with IP addresses, switches work with MAC addresses.

**Switches** also have multiple interfaces, so they need to keep a forwarding table that binds one or more MAC addresses to an interface.

 **What is a switch?**
A switch is a hardware component in network infrastructure that performs the switching process. The switch connects network devices, such as computers and servers, to one another.

**How is a switch different from a router?**
A switch connects devices within a LAN (local-area network) by using MAC addresses to identify where to send data packets. A router connects LANs to other area networks or to the internet. A router uses IP addresses to route data packets.
