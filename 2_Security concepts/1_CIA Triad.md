- # Confidentiality
    
    **Confidentiality is set of rules to protect the sensitive data for the organization and everyone associated with it,**
    
    **and Prevent the confidential data and sensitive information from reaching to Wrong People.**
    
    **→ So what is the basis Confidentiality data , for example**
    
    **PII** → personally identifiable information 
    
    - Name 
    - Address
    - SSN 
    - Telephone
    
    **PHI** → Protected Health Information 
    
    - demographic information 
    -  medical history
    -  tests 
    
    > But the standard of confidential data is not fixed for everyone, for example in company X, [address, phone, name] is considered visible data to everyone because the general policy of the company allows this according to the nature of the work of the site or institution, while in company B, this information is considered dangerous information that cannot be shown or disclosed.

    ### When we say that there is strong confidentiality, some points must be taken into account and secured, the most important of which are
    
    - **Access Control**
    - **Confidentiality policies**
    - **Encryption**
    - **Data Classification**
    - **Authentication**
    - **Anti-virus software**
    - **Endpoint protections**
    - **Endpoint detection and response (EDR)**
    - **Identity and access management (IAM)**
    - **Intrusion detection and protection systems (IDS/IPS)**
    - **Physical access controls**
    - **Strong passwords**
    
- # Integrity
    
   - Integrity means that data is protected from unauthorized modification or deletion So that it is not modified or deleted by unauthorized parties. This is an important element of data cleanliness, reliability and accuracy.
   
   - Hashing, encryption, digital certificates, and digital signatures are examples of the integrity component of the CIA triad. These methods verify integrity and ensure that authenticity cannot be repudiated or denied
   
  - Examples of attacks on integrity include email fraud attacks (which compromise the integrity of communications), financial fraud and embezzlement through modification of financial records, even attacks like Stuxnet that impacted the integrity of industrial control systems data flows to cause physical damage.
    
- # Availability
    
    Availability means that users have timely and reliable access to data when they need it. This means that systems must be protected from tampering.  
    
    Because of this, it is commonly given priority over the other two elements of the CIA triad—confidentiality and integrity. 
    
    Examples of availability disruptions that the CIA triad seeks to avoid and mitigate are DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks and ransomware. These, along with other availability-related attack vectors, are the focus of security efforts related to availability. Even if data is kept confidential and its integrity maintained, it is of no value to anyone if it is inaccessible.   
    
    ### Some points to consider
    
    - **Load Balancing**:
    - **System Uptime → systems accessible  in any time**
    - **Disaster Recovery**
    - **Redundancy**
