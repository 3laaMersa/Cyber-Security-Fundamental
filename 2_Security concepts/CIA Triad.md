- # Confidentiality
    
    **Confidentiality is set of rules to protect the sensitive data for the organization and everyone associated with it,**
    
    **and Prevent the confidential data and sensitive information from reaching to Wrong People.**
    
    **→ So what is the basis Confidentiality data , for example**
    
    **PII** → personally identifiable information 
    
    - Name 
    - Address
    - SSN 
    - Telephone
    
    **PHI** → Protected Health Information 
    
    - demographic information 
    -  medical history
    -  tests 
    
    > But the standard of confidential data is not fixed for everyone, for example in company X, [address, phone, name] is considered visible data to everyone because the general policy of the company allows this according to the nature of the work of the site or institution, while in company B, this information is considered dangerous information that cannot be shown or disclosed.

    ### When we say that there is strong confidentiality, some points must be taken into account and secured, the most important of which are
    
    - **Access Control**
    - **Confidentiality policies**
    - **Encryption**
    - **Data Classification**
    - **Authentication**
    - **Anti-virus software**
    - **Endpoint protections**
    - **Endpoint detection and response (EDR)**
    - **Identity and access management (IAM)**
    - **Intrusion detection and protection systems (IDS/IPS)**
    - **Physical access controls**
    - **Strong passwords**
    
- # Integrity
    
   - Integrity means that data is protected from unauthorized modification or deletion So that it is not modified or deleted by unauthorized parties. This is an important element of data cleanliness, reliability and accuracy.
   
   - Hashing, encryption, digital certificates, and digital signatures are examples of the integrity component of the CIA triad. These methods verify integrity and ensure that authenticity cannot be repudiated or denied
   
  - Examples of attacks on integrity include email fraud attacks (which compromise the integrity of communications), financial fraud and embezzlement through modification of financial records, even attacks like Stuxnet that impacted the integrity of industrial control systems data flows to cause physical damage.
    
- # Availability
    
    Availability means that users have timely and reliable access to data when they need it. This means that systems must be protected from tampering.  
    
    Because of this, it is commonly given priority over the other two elements of the CIA triad—confidentiality and integrity. 
    
    Examples of availability disruptions that the CIA triad seeks to avoid and mitigate are DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks and ransomware. These, along with other availability-related attack vectors, are the focus of security efforts related to availability. Even if data is kept confidential and its integrity maintained, it is of no value to anyone if it is inaccessible.   
    
    ### Some points to consider
    
    - **Load Balancing**:
    - **System Uptime → systems accessible  in any time**
    - **Disaster Recovery**
    - **Redundancy**
    


- #  Policy

The Policy in CyberSecurity is guidelines for transferring company data,
accessing private systems, etc

the main goal of the policy is to Achieve the Cyber Security goals(CIA
(Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).

- **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):**
Defines what users are and are not allowed to do with organizational IT resources.
Covers internet use, email communication, social media use, and handling sensitive data.

- **Access Control Policy:**
Establishes rules for who can access specific resources and under what circumstances.
Defines user permissions, authentication mechanisms, and authorization processes.

- **Data Protection Policy:**
Explains how to handle, store and transmit sensitive information. Ensures compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

- **Incident Response Policy:**
Provides a framework for responding to security incidents and breaches.
Defines roles, responsibilities, and procedures for detecting, reporting, and remediating incidents.


- **Network Security Policy:**
Defines guidelines for securing an organization's network infrastructure.
Includes firewall configurations, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and VPN use.

- **Password Policy:**
Specifies requirements for creating and managing passwords.
Covers password complexity, expiration, reuse and storage.


- **Remote Access Policy:**
Specifies the conditions under which remote access to an organization's network is permitted.
Defines the use of VPNs, secure connections, and remote desktop protocols.

- **Email and Communication Policy:**
Demonstrates acceptable use of email and other communication tools.
Includes rules for handling attachments, phishing awareness, and encrypting communications
