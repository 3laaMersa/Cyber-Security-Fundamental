# Introduction to Ethical Hacking

- **Ethical hacking is to scan vulnerabilities and to find potential threats on a computer or network.**
- An ethical hacker finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web application or network and reports them to the organization. So, letâ€™s explore more about Ethical Hacking step-by-step. These are various types of hackers
### **(1)** White Hat Hackers (Cyber-Security Hacker)
- we look for bugs and ethically report them to the organization
- We are authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to them
- White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself
### **(2)** Black Hat Hackers (Cracker)
- They unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data
- They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain
-  They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent.
- One of the most common methods used by black hat hackers is phishing, which involves tricking people into providing credentials or personal information via fake websites or emails. 
- Once they have access to this information, they can use it to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks.
#  The 5 Phases of Ethical Hacking
> **The process of legal and authorized attempts to discover and successfully exploiting the computer system in an attempt to make the computer system more secure is called Ethical Hacking. This process includes a probe for vulnerability and providing proof of concept (POC) attacks to visualize that vulnerabilities are actually present in the system. A Good Penetration tester always provides a specific recommendation to remove the flaws in the system discovered during the penetration test. Penetration testing is also known by some other terms like**

  >**There is a term called Vulnerability Assessment which is quite similar to Penetration Testing. Vulnerability Assessment means reviewing services and systems for security issues. Many people use pen testing and vulnerability assessment interchangeably for each other but they are not the same. The penetration testing process is a step ahead of vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability Assessment only discovers flaws in the system but PT provides a way to remove those flaws as well.**

-  So penetration testing is about assessing vulnerabilities and create a proof of concept (POC) to exploit them and how to fixed the bugs
- But a vulnerability assessment is only about identifying the bug without recommending how to fix it

**So what 5 Phases**

**1. Reconnaissance:**

**2. Scanning**

**3. Exploitation / Gaining Access:**

**4. Post-Exploitation for deeper access**

**5. Reporting your findings**
